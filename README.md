# LITA_Class_Documentation
This is where I documented my first project while learning data analysis on Incubator Hub

I focused on Excel and worked with a dataset to calculate some key stats. I looked at the grand total and average salaries, pinpointed the highest and lowest salaries, and even found the fourth highest and third lowest salaries. I also played around with conditional functions, which allowed me to dig deeper into the data. I calculated the total salary for Bayelsa, the average salary for Oyo, the highest salary in Edo, the lowest in Taraba, and counted the staff in Nassarawa. Excelâ€™s conditional functions really impressed me with how effectively they can target specific criteria!
